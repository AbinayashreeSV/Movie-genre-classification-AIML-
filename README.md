Classify movie genres based on plot descriptions using machine learning and deep learning techniques.


# 🎬 Movie Genre Classification (AIML)

This project aims to classify the genres of movies based on their plot descriptions using various machine learning and deep learning models. The dataset is derived from IMDb movie metadata, and the models explore feature extraction techniques like TF-IDF and apply classification algorithms including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and an LSTM-based neural network.

## 🚀 Features
- Text cleaning and preprocessing using NLTK
- TF-IDF feature extraction
- Multi-label binarization for genres
- Classical ML models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- Deep learning model: LSTM using Keras
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix

## 🧠 Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- NLTK, Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow, Keras
- Matplotlib

## 📁 Dataset
IMDb movie dataset with columns including plot descriptions and associated genres.

## 📊 Output
Performance comparison of multiple models to identify the best-performing classifier for multi-label genre prediction.
